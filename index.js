// To get started, you’re first going to connect to the registration endpoint. It lives here:
//
// http://challenge.code2040.org/api/register
//
// The registration endpoint expects a JSON dictionary with two keys, token and github. This JSON should be sent in the body of your HTTP request.
//
// For token, pass in a string with the token you see above. For github, pass in the URL of the repository you created in the last step.
//
// Hint: HTTP has a few types of “methods.” The registration endpoint is going to be expecting you to use POST to send your JSON.
